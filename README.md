## Abandoned

Following the launch of
[Charge on Solar](https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-app/charge-on-solar),
I have discontinued work on TESPO, as both projects were aimed at achieving the same goal.

Here are my remaining development TODOs:

- simulation - record charge/discharge loss

- simulation - add vehicle battery charge ratio

- simulation index
  - show differences
  - show season stats

- simulation - show full details

- simulation - add prev/next links
  - option to carry-over battery percentage

- placard simulation
  - date/time "slider"
  - scenario selection
  - enable/disable TESPO
